## General Information
- Lending club case study is analysis of various factors on loan repayment. The insights of this analysis will help banks to identify if a person is likely to replay loan or not.
- The idea behind implementing this project is to underatand how real business problems are solved using EDA. Apart from applying EDA techniques, we also learnt about risk analytics in banking and financial services.
-  Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- Loan data set  contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.


## Conclusions
- Loan default rate is inversly related to annual income. More is annual income less the person is likely to default.
- Loan offered for a period of 60 months is more likely to be charged off as compared to loan of 30 months.
- Loan default rate is inversly related to debt to income ratio. The person with high debt to income ration is more likely to default as compared to person with low debt to income ratio
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
